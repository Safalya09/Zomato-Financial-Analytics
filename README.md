Design an interactive sales/financial dashboard using **Power BI** or **Tableau** to help business stakeholders make informed decisions.

Microsoft Excel / CSV Dataset (from Kaggle)
GitHub for version control



Dataset
Used a publicly available Sales dataset from Kaggle containing:
- Sales, Profit, and Discount data

- Regional and temporal data (Monthly/Quarterly)


Key KPIs
The dashboard includes the following KPIs:
 Total Sales
 Total Profit

 Region-wise Sales Performance


 1. What are the key elements of a dashboard?
A good dashboard includes KPIs, visuals like charts, and filters or slicers for interactivity. It should present data clearly, so stakeholders can quickly understand what's happening and take action.

2. What is a KPI?
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable value that shows how well a business is achieving a specific objective. For example, Total Sales, Profit Margin, or Customer Retention Rate.

3. What are slicers in Power BI?
Slicers are interactive filters that let users select specific values like regions or dates. When you click on them, the entire dashboard updates based on your selection.

4. Difference between Power BI and Tableau?
Power BI is more affordable and integrates well with Microsoft tools, making it great for business users. Tableau is more flexible in visual design and better for complex data storytelling.

5. How do you make a dashboard interactive?
I use slicers, filters, and drill-down options so users can explore the data themselves. Navigation buttons or tabs also help users switch between different views.

6. How do you deal with large datasets in dashboards?
I aggregate data, apply filters, and use only the necessary fields to reduce load. e.

7. What chart types do you use for trend analysis?
 I use area charts or bar charts when comparing trends across different categories.
